/**
        \brief Class that connects to PolicyKit as the agent and
                gets events on when PK wants an auth check.

        Class to bridge the interface for the PolicyKit agent registration
        and signaling. It uses a small helper GLib object which is a subclass
        of libpolicykitagent's PolkitAgentListener class. This is done in
        GObject, and then this class exists to provide C++ structures around
        that class.

        If requested the agent will use the passed in AuthManager instance to
        create authorization UI's to query the user. It maintains the cancellable
        objects from GLib and will request the AuthManager to cancel any UI
        requests if PolicyKit asks.

        \note The Agent Class should be instantiated once, as PolicyKit only
        allows one agent per session. Creating multiple instances will
        result in PolicyKit returning an error.
