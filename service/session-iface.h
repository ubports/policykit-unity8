/** \brief An interface for the session functionality of libpolicykitagent
        so that we can mock it out.

    It is basically impossible to test against PAM without going
    crazy, so we created an interface to mock it out. This class
    makes the session interface into nice C++ objects but also
    virtualizes it so that it can be mocked.
