/** \brief Class that tracks all the various Authentications that can be
                in-flight at a given time and gives them a thread to work on.

        The authentication manager is mostly a tracker and factory class for
        Authentication objects. When an authentication is requested it creates
        the object and keeps track of it until it either completes the
        authentication or is cancelled. It also keeps a GLib mainloop around
        that the authentication objects can all use.

        For bookkeeping purposes this class is also the one that initializes
        and uninitializes libnotify and makes sure the notification server
        has the proper capabilities.
